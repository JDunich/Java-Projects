# Java-Projects

### 🎉Init🎉 ###

This repository is comprised of a handful of Java written programs that range from simple to more complicated which I wrote during my first year at university. Some of the following files Standard Libraries in order to display images made from the code. To download and use these libraries, please follow this [LINK](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/). The Summary of each file can be seen below!

## Sierpinski.java ##

The Sierpinski File takes an integer command-line argument n and draws a Sierpinski triangle recursively of the order of n that fits snugly inside the outline. This class uses the previously mentioned Std Library API to draw and display the triangle.

## Charge.java ##

The Charge.java class uses the Std Library in order to map out the electric potentials in different areas around a charged particle.

## HadamardMatrix.java ##

The Hadamard Matrix class builds a matrix based on the user input n. Please read the following link for the full description of a [Hadamard Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard_matrix).

## Turtle.java 🐢 ##

The Turtle class takes in two conditions from the command line, n and decay, and uses these conditions in order to calculate the turtle's movement.

## RandomWalker.java 🚶‍♂️ ##

The program RandomWalker takes an int command-line argument n and simulates the motion of a random walk for n steps. Prints the location at each step (including the starting point), treating the starting point as the origin (0, 0). Also, prints the square of the final Euclidean distance from the origin.

## PolygonTransform.java ##

The PolygonTransform class mutates a polygon based on the given user input. These mutations include shifting, scaling, and rotating.
