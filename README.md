### 🎉Init🎉 ###

This repository is comprised of a handful of Java written programs that range from simple to more complicated. Some of the following files Standard Libraries in order to display images made from the code. To download and use these libraries, please follow this [LINK](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/). The Summary of each file can be seen below!

## Sierpinski.java ##

The Sierpinski File takes an integer command-line argument n and draws a Seripinski triangle recursivley of the order of n that fits snugly inside the outline. This class uses the previously mentioned Std Library API to draw and display the triangle.

## Charge.java ##

The Charge.java class uses the Std Library in order to map out the electric potentials in different areas around a charged particle.

## HadamardMatrix.java ##

The Hadamard Matrix class builds a matrix based on the user input n. Please read the following link for the full desrciption of a [Hadamard Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard_matrix).
